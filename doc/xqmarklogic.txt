Integrates MarkLogic XQueries into vim, and displays the result in another
window.  This is a filetype plugin that is only available when in an XQuery
file.

Note Vim 7.3 and later hides '|' and '*'.  If using an earlier version ignore
any '*' or '|' surrounding Commands or variables names.

INTRODUCTION						*xqmarklogic-intro*

xqmarklogic maps <LEADER>B and <C-CR> (CONTROL-RETURN like MarkLogic Query
Console) to run an XQuery against MarkLogic server using curl and a custom App
Server running a short XQuery file.  It displays the results in a new
|xmarklogic-results| window.

It was inspired by this webpage:
http://superiorautomaticdictionary.com/vim-nirvana-interactive-xquery-with-marklogic

Git repository at: http://github.com/coledarr/vim-xqmarklogic
	Pull requests welcome.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION						*xqmarklogic-install*

This plugin will need to be installed.
Few ways to do this:
	1. use pathogen.vim https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
	2. use vundle https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
	3. use another plugin manager
	4. Otherwise copy the doc/* and ftplugin/* to your corresponding ~/.vim/
	directories (create them if they don't exist yet).  Run :helptags

See pathogen.vim's documentation to set it up (it's easy). Then put the
xqmarklogic directory in your ~/.vim/bundle directory, and run :Helptags

Vundle has even more features (can update plugins automatically) See the
documentation from the link above.

MARKLOGIC CONFIGURATION				*xqmarklogic-config-marklogic*
You will need MarkLogic running, a MarkLogic App Server setup to run a XQuery,
curl, and this xqmarklogic file type plugin.  MarkLogic provides an XML
database, and even has a free version called MarkLogic Express.
	See: http://www.marklogic.com/

This plugin was developed and used with MarkLogic6, but should work with
earlier and later versions.

Script is in the file xqmarklogic/xq.xqry.  This script takes text input
and runs it against the database using xdmp:eval.  This opens up your whole
MarkLogic server to have arbitrary XQuery run against any database by whoever
is authorized to access this App Server. Read the |xqmarklogic-security|
section.  This probably shouldn't be on the production server, and should be
protected.

In MarkLogic Admin interface go to Group->Default->App Servers, then the
"Create HTTP" tab.  Then fill in a few fields.
	"server name" - Can be whatever you want.
	"root" - Is somewhere accessible by MarkLogic server to read the
		xq.xqy file.  I have put it in /opt/MarkLogic.local/
	"port" - whatever port this App Server should listen on

Make sure the xq.xqy file has been copied and is readable by the MarkLogic
server.

curl can support SSL, but the plugin isn't setup to support this.  Patches
welcome.  wget doesn't work, again patches welcome.

VIMRC CONFIGURATION				*xqmarklogic-config-vimrc*
There are a few settings needed in your |vimrc| file

Use the port number you set when configuring the App Server, not the
default 8002 >
	let g:xqmarklogic_defaultPort='8002'
<

Use the user and password needed to access the App Server you setup >
	let g:xqmarklogic_defaultUser='admin'
	let g:xqmarklogic_defaultPassword='password'
<

If MakrLogic isn't running on the localhost, you'll need to add the host as
well >
	let g:xqmarklogic_defaultHost='marklogichost'
<

For more details and other options and setting see |xqmarklogic-options|
These settings are per buffers.

==============================================================================
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS					*xqmarklogic-security*

As mentioned above xq.xqy has some security considerations.  It can run any
XQuery against any of the MarkLogic databases.  It is only as protected as the
App Server (password in the clear with http by default).  xqmarklogic
doesn't support ssl now, but that could be added (patches welcome).  So be
aware.

Second issue is less obvious and has the potential to expose the MarkLogic
password to everyone who can login into the local machine.  Vim stores command
history in ~/.viminfo. If you set and use |xqmarklogic-options| below (particularly
the one for the MarkLogic password) from command mode, those commands are
stored in the viminfo file.  Pull requests with fixes for this are welcome.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS AND MAPPINGS					*xqmarklogic-map-cmds*

MAPPINGS						*xqmarklogic-mappings*

<LEADER>B	Run current buffer as an XQuery against the MarkLogic
		App Server you setup earlier.  This mapping runs XQmlquery, so
		it is easy to remap this if desired.  Set to something else
		with |g:xqmarklogic_ExecQueryKey|

<CTRL-CR>	Same as above.  Control-Return that MarkLogic QueryConsole
		uses.  Set to something else with |g:xqmarklogic_MLExecQueryKey|

<LEADER>E	Run XQexploreDb which will list for each document, a database
		URI, the root element, and any collections it is part of.
		It is somewhat like the "Explore" button for a database in Set
		to something else with |g:xqmarklogic_ExploreDBKey|

These can be turned off with |g:xqmarklogic_noMappings| in your vimrc to turn off 

COMMANDS						*xqmarklogic-commands*
*XQtoggleShowCurlCmd*	toggles showing curl command used in the results
			window in an XML comment.  It is off by default since
			the command contains "--" and thus can't be in a valid
			XML comment.

*XQtoggleShowDuration*	toggle showing the duration of the query.  On by
			default.

*XQtoggleShowDb*		toggle showing the Database used by the query.  On by
			default.

*XQtoggleOutCleanup*	toggle if xml output is cleaned up or not. (insert
			newlines between empty adjacent tags, reindent XML,
			set foldlevel=10)

*XQsetUser*		sets the user to use for login to the string argument

*XQsetPassword*		prompts for the password to use in the current XQuery
			buffer.

*XQsetDefaultPassword*	prompts for the default password to use in all XQuery
			buffers if not already set
			
*XQsetURI*		sets the URI to use to the string argument

*XQsetHost*		sets the host to use to the string argument

*XQsetPort*		sets the port to use to the argument

*XQsetScript*		sets the script to use to the string argument

*XQsetDatabase*		sets the database to query against to the string
			argument.

*XQsetMaxLinesIndent*	sets the max lines to indent in the results window,
			default to 400.

*XQdisplaySettings*	Displays what the current buffer settings are.

*XQmlquery*		Run the current buffer against the MarkLogic server
			and display the output in a new results window.

*XQexploreDb*		Display in a new results window each document in the current database, a
			database URI, the root element, and any collections it
			is part of.  This is very similar to the "Explore"
			button in MarkLogic's Query Console.
==============================================================================
RESULTS WINDOW						*xqmarklogic-results*

The results window is a |buftype| nofile, with the filetype set to xml, and
has a few mappings for convenience.  These mappings are only set for the results
window, and are not affected by |g:xqmarklogic_noMappings|.

q		Close the results window.

<LEADER>B	Will refresh the output of the window.  Set to something else
		with |g:xqmarklogic_ExecQueryKey|
<C-CR>		Will refresh the output of the window.  Set to something else
		with |g:xqmarklogic_MLExecQueryKey|
<LEADER>E	Will to list document URIs and other
		information.  Will refresh the results window if it was a
		database listing, otherwise opens a new window.  Set to
		something else with |g:xqmarklogic_ExploreDBKey|

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION						*xqmarklogic-options*
	Options and Settings

Global default values can be set in you |vimrc| file.

*g:xqmarklogic_defaultHost*	The default Host name to use, if not set
				uses 'localhost'
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultURI*	The default URI, if not set uses 'http://'
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultPort*	The default Port, if not set uses 8002
				(which is used by MarkLogic by default and
				wont work)
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultUser*	The default User, if not set uses 'admin'

				uses '/xq.xqy'
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultDb*		The default Database to query against, if
				not set uses 'Documents'
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultMaxLinesIndent*	If results are longer than this many
				lines skip trying to indent them.  Defaults to
				400.
*g:xqmarklogic_defaultNoOutCleanup*	Turns on (1) or off (0) Output
				Cleanup.  Default true (1). Cleanup: split
				lines where tags are not separated by a
